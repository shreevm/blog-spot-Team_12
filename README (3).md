Description:

Develop a comprehensive educational demonstration of a React Java Spring Boot full-stack application. The application will feature a basic blog with essential functionalities including JWT authentication, the ability to create new users, and complete CRUD operations (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) for both posts and comments. Upon starting the application, the blog will be pre-populated with demo data. Users can either create new accounts or log in using any author's full name, with the password set as "password." Additionally, an administrator account is available with the username "admin" and password "admin."

Implementation of Technologies :


Frontend: React
Utilize React for the user interface to create a dynamic and responsive web application.

Backend: Java Spring Boot
Employ Java Spring Boot as the backend framework for building robust and scalable server-side logic.
Choose a suitable database mysql to store and manage blog-related data.

Data Pre-population: Demo Dat
Integrate functionality to pre-populate the blog with demo data upon application startup for a seamless user experience.
User Management: Create and Authenticate Users
Develop features for creating new users and authenticating them within the application.

CRUD Operations: Posts and Comments

Implement full CRUD operations (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) for both blog posts and comments, allowing users to interact seamlessly with the content.

Default User Credentials:
Enable user registration with any author's full name and a default password of "password." For administrator access, use the predefined username "admin" with the password "admin."

Hosted the application using vercel.
